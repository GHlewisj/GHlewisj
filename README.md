-  My name is Jada Lewis.
-  Iâ€™m currently working on advancing python programming proficiency.
-  I have not been employed in a data analytics position or any position requiring programming skills since 2017.
-  The coding scripts in this repository are not connected to a project; its purpose is to demonstrate the ability to think about an analytic challenge and write a programming solution from scratch.
-  I wrote the codes in 2022 and 2023.
